# Purpose

This repository of JavaScript scripts demonstrates various REST APIs supported by Coinbase Exchange and Commerce.

While originally designed to power the Coinbase Commerce Workshop, these scripts will work on their own with proper API credentials.

If you are a prospective or current user of Coinbase Commerce and would like a hands-on walkthrough of the workshop visit here: [https://commerce.saworkshop.dev/](https://commerce.saworkshop.dev/)

All scripts require use of Node.js 18+.
