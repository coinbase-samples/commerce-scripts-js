## Coinbase Exchange scripts

These Coinbase Exchange scripts are developed to complement payments received via Coinbase Commerce.

Commerce and Exchange work in tandem to allow businesss and individuals accept cryptocurrencies for goods and services.

## Getting started

These scripts make use of command line environment variables so that sensitive information does not need to be included in the scripts themselves. Update the following information and run from your command line or choose your favorite method of storing sensitive information to proceed.

Reminder: Use Node.js v18+

```
export EXCHANGE_ACCESS_KEY=ACCESS_KEY_HERE
export EXCHANGE_PASSPHRASE=PASSPHRASE_HERE
export EXCHANGE_SECRET=SECRET_KEY_HERE
export EXCHANGE_BASE_URL=https://api.exchange.coinbase.com

```
